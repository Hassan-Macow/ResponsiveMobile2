        <h2>Brief Info About Library</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                A library, which may vary widely in size, 
                may be organized for use and maintained by 
                a public body such as a government; an 
                institution such as a school or museum; 
                a corporation; or a private individual. 
                In addition to providing materials, 
                libraries also provide the services of 
                librarians who are trained and experts 
                at finding, selecting, circulating and 
                organizing information and at interpreting 
                information needs, navigating and analyzing 
                very large amounts of information with 
                a variety of resources.

                Library buildings often provide quiet 
                areas for studying, as well as common 
                areas for group study and collaboration, 
                and may provide public facilities for 
                access to their electronic resources; 
                for instance: computers and access to 
                the Internet.
